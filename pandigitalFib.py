"""
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fnâˆ’1 + Fnâˆ’2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, 
is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital
(contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). 
And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number 
for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits 
AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
