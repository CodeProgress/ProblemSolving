#If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, 
#composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, 
#and two discs were taken at random, 
#it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, 
#P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
#
#The next such arrangement, 
#for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random,
#is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
#
#By finding the first arrangement 
#to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, 
#determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
